# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## üìö Types of Design Patterns

- **Creational**
- **Structural**
- **Behavioral**

---

## üîß Creational Patterns

### 1. Singleton
- Restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
- Uses synchronized methods to ensure thread safety.

### 2. Prototype
- Used to create a clone of the object in a structured manner.

### 3. Builder
- Used to create a complex object step by step.
- Helps decide whether a property should be added to the instance or not.

### 4. Factory
- Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of object created.

### 5. Abstract Factory
- An extended version where entire families of related products with consistent interfaces are created.

## üèóÔ∏è Structural Patterns

### 1. Adapter
- Connects incompatible interfaces.
- Converts one form to another (e.g., JSON to XML).

### 2. Bridge
- Connects two similar objects using composition.

### 3. Composite
- Uses composition at multiple levels to form a tree-like structure.

### 4. Facade
- Combines multiple classes into a single interface to simplify usage.

### 5. Flyweight
- Reduces memory usage by sharing objects that have intrinsic and extrinsic states.

### 6. Proxy
- Acts as a cache for objects to improve access time.

### 7. Decorator
- Adds additional features to objects dynamically while adhering to the open/closed principle.

## üîÅ Behavioral Patterns

### 1. Command
- Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting users parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.

### 2. Iterator
- Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its internal representation.

### 3. Mediator
- Defines an object that controls how a set of objects interact.

### 4. Observer
- Implements a one-to-many dependency. When one object changes state, its dependents are notified.

### 5. Memento
- Saves the state of an object so it can be restored to that state later.

### 6. State
- Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

### 7. Visitor
- Separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

### 8. Template
- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm and allows subclasses to override certain steps.

### 9. Strategy
- Allows changing the behavior of an object dynamically by switching algorithms.

### 10. Chain of Responsibility
- Passes a request along a chain of handlers where each handler decides either to process the request or pass it on.

This repository documents key design patterns along with simple definitions. Ideal for interviews, revisions, or when building scalable architectures.
